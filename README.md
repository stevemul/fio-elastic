# fio-elastic
Basic fio container with a simple python script that modifies the json output and pushes it to elasticsearch

Heavily influenced by https://github.com/portworx/fio-tools - but without the need for plotting and wanting to push the results to elasticsearch instead, it seemed better to start a new repo.
